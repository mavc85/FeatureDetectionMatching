# FeatureDetectionMatching
Identifies a pairings between points in an image and a corresponding point in another image. These correspondences stitch multiple images together into a panorama. This project detects discriminating features (reasonably invariant to translation, rotation, and illumination) in an image, finding the best matching features in another image.
